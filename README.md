# Project Report: Text Processing System

## Abstract

**Development Summary**: This project has developed an advanced information retrieval system that is capable of retrieving corresponding input words with high precision. The key objective was to construct a workable and sensible application that was able to handle textual flows of different sizes, and capable of incorporating the modern technologies from the end to end of the application.


**Objectives**:

- Developing technology by running crawls on the internet, indexing documents and query presentation to users will be my area of design and implementation.

- We intend to design an easily navigable and intuitive web interface to enhance the user experience.

- Develop a basic NL Process towards better search results.


**Next Steps**:

- Incorporate NLP features of high rank: semantic search, for example.

- Implement scaling to the system by the ability to process mass data and simultaneous connections.

- Improve the user interface by adding elements that are more dynamic and providing proper displays.


## Overview


**Solution Outline**: The fully functional tool integrates the components of web crawler, indexer, and query processor into a single system enabling the graduals search and indexing of text documents.


**Relevant Literature**: The design was influenced by current readings in the fields of information retrieval, web crawlers technologies, and natural language processing, which were highly oriented towards the improvement of its functionality and efficiency with respect to scalability.


**Proposed System**: A web application built on Flask and Python back end and as smart as it can be in search, performing complex user queries and returns the needed results quickly.


## Design

**System Capabilities**:

- High-speed web crawling and indexing become to be able to use.

- In-time handle with the help of NLP improved basic technology.

- The web interface for query submission and result display should be user-friendly.


**Interactions**:

- Users interact with the Flask web application in that they put in several commands.

- Backend services process all data and also, when communicated with the front end through request, they respond accordingly.


**Integration**:

- Utilizing BeautifulSoup for web scraping, alongside even the native Python libraries for the indexing, and also Flask for web-server administration.


## Architecture


**Software Components**:

- **Web Crawler**: The website, which is constructed using the SimpleBeautifulSoup library, is highly capable of collecting and navigating web content.

- **Indexer**: Use of Python dictionaries and sets for writing an inverted index for the data fetched.

- **Query Processor**: The programming of Flask application serves both as the interface of the web and as the mechanism that searches queries accessing the index.


**Interfaces**:

- Discoverability via RESTful API endpoints for search.

- Graphical User Interface for end user interaction. Listening to my favorite music can have a profound impact on my emotional state and overall well-being.


**Implementation**:

- Python, with Flask for handling the web request and HTML/CSS serving the front end of the system.


## Operation


**Software Commands**:

- Run the crawler: Run: `python crawler.py`

- Start the indexer: `python indexer.py`

- Launch the Flask app: ``` flask run ```


**Inputs**:

- The users obtain search results by entering their queries into a form on the site.

- Crawler and indexer across scripts are configured at the centrally located script level.


**Installation**:

- Invoke is the software platform built on Python 3.6+ and plugged with Flask, BeautifulSoup4, and Requests.

- Start by setting up dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.


## Conclusion


**Results**: It scans the text of the given query and locates relevant documents based on the inverted index and provides search results in a matter of seconds.


**Outputs**: The search queries are brought onto a webpage via a web interface and the results are ranked by relevance.


**Caveats/Cautions**: This solution does not adequately handle large sets of data or high-load cases.


## Data Sources


**Links, Downloads, Access Information**: Data is being constantly updated from public contents which are crawled to browse the web. We have chosen particular sources here, listing example domains, which have been defined in the crawler configuration.


## Test Cases


**Framework**: Python’s unittest framework.

**Harness**: Test-scripts are used for the purpose of verifying whether a module works properly and is robust to match expected functionality or not.

**Coverage**: The focus is on basics, uncovering the need to develop the system while protocol grows.
